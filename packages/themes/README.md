# @carbon/themes

> Themes for applying color in the Carbon Design System

## Getting started

To install `@carbon/themes` in your project, you will need to run the
following command using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install -S @carbon/themes
```

If you prefer [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/), use the following
command instead:

```bash
yarn add @carbon/themes
```

## Usage

You can use `@carbon/themes` in JavaScript or Sass by including this
package in your project. By default, `@carbon/themes` provides a set
of color tokens that are pre-defined for a specific theme. Currently,
we offer the following color themes: white, gray 10, gray 90, gray 100

You can preview all of the token values for this on the [Carbon Design
System website](https://next.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage)
.

### Sass

If you're project is using Sass, you can include this package and the
corresponding default theme by writing the following in your Sass
file:

```scss
@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';
```

By default, the white theme will be initialized. If you would like to
include another theme, you can do so by calling one of our theme
mixins. For example:

```scss
@import '@carbon/themes/scss/themes';

// Call the gray 10 theme
@include carbon--theme-g10();

// Call the gray 90 theme
@include carbon--theme-g90();

// Call the gray 100 theme
@include carbon--theme-g100();
```

### JavaScript

If you're looking to use these themes in JavaScript, we export a
variety of bindings for you to use, including:

```js
import {
  // An object of all themes
  themes,

  // Direct theme values
  white,
  g10,
  g90,
  g100,

  // Specific token values
  interactive01,
  interactive02,
} from '@carbon/themes';
```
